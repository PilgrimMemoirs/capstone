eyeglasses measurement application
###Problem Statement
in order to be able to order glasses online one must provide a few measurements (for example: the distance between the pupils) which are not a common thing to know nor easy to measure professionally by oneself (especially in kids..). the application will get pictures of faces and process it to output the required measurements.

###Draft Feature Set
1. user interface that will enable to upload a picture.
2. a tool that will process the picture and send back the output.

fax machine game application
###Problem Statement
not really a problem in here... just making the online version of this game:
The first player begins by writing any sentence or phrase they wish, though bizarre or surreal offerings are generally preferred. The next player attempts to come up with an illustration that represents the sentence. The paper is folded over so that only the picture can be seen, then passed to the next player, who attempts to formulate a caption for the illustration. Usually there are some restrictions on what can appear in the illustration — alphanumerics are commonly forbidden — to ensure that the third player cannot easily replicate the original sentence. Once the third player has captioned the illustration, the paper is folded over so that only the caption can be seen, and passed to the next player.
The pattern continues until the game ends.

###Draft Feature Set
1. user interface that will enable to take text input form the user.
2. user interface that will enable to take drawing input from the user.
3. presenting user input.
